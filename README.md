# FitnessMate

FitnessMate is an Android fitness-tracking mobile application with the features of online automatic activity identification and energy expenditure estimation. 
Every five seconds the activity perfomed is automatically recognized and the calories expended on that activity are aggregated. The user is able to check at any time of the day the calories burned in total and per activity.

FitnessMate automatically detects 5 types of activities: walking, jogging, cycling and walking upstairs/downstairs providing 
the calories consumed on each exercise. 

Developed as part of my thesis: "Automatic caloric expenditure estimation with smartphoneâ€™s built-in sensors".
